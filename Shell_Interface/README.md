# Project 2: UNIX Shell

UNIX Shell. (Operating System Concepts, 10th Edition, Chapter 2)

## Description

This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate process. Your implementation will support input and output redirection, as well as pipes as a form of IPC between a pair of commands. Completing this project will involve using the UNIX `fork()` , `exec()` ,` wait()` , `dup2()` , and `pipe()` system calls and can be completed on any Linux, UNIX , or mac OS system.

## Environment

- OS: Ubuntu 18.04 (Linux kernel version: 5.3.5)
- Compiler: GCC 7.4.0
